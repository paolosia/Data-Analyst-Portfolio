# Data Analysis Portfolio

This repository showcases a collection of data analysis projects undertaken to demonstrate my skills and knowledge in data science and analytics. 

**Projects:**

* **Adidas Webstore Project:** 
    * Analyzed inventory management and sales trends for the Adidas Webstore across four countries: USA, Belgium, Germany, and the UK.
    * Utilized Python for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    * Developed interactive dashboards using Power BI to visualize key insights and facilitate data-driven decision-making.
    * **Contents:** 
        * `Adidas.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data analysis.
        * `Adidas.pbix`: Power BI report file.

* **Bank Customer Churn Analysis:**
    * Investigated the factors contributing to customer churn in a banking context.
    * Conducted in-depth data analysis using Python to identify key drivers of customer attrition.
    * Generated a comprehensive report (PDF) summarizing the findings and recommendations.
    * **Contents:**
        * `Bank_Customer_Churn_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data analysis.
        * `Bank_Customer_Churn_Analysis_Report.pdf`: PDF report of the analysis.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

* **Data Wrangling & Cleaning:** Data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Data visualization and summary statistics using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
* **Machine Learning:** Model building and evaluation for predictive modeling (e.g., churn prediction).
* **Data Storytelling:** Effective communication of data insights through reports and visualizations.
* **Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Power BI, Jupyter Notebook.

**Note:**

This portfolio is continuously evolving as I undertake new and challenging data analysis projects.
