# Adidas Webstore Shoe Analysis

Welcome to my analysis of the Adidas Webstore Shoe data! This project focuses on inventory management and explores insights to help optimize stock levels and improve operational efficiency.

---

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze e-commerce data from the Adidas webstore to gain actionable insights about inventory patterns. By examining stock availability across different dimensions, we aim to:

- Identify products with low stock levels.
- Spot trends in stock availability by country and shoe size.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to enhance inventory planning.

---

## Dataset Overview
This project uses three primary datasets:

1. **Country Dimension Data**: Information about the countries where Adidas operates.
2. **Shoe Dimension Data**: Details about the sizes and dimensions of shoes.
3. **Shoe Fact Data**: Facts about inventory, including product IDs, stock availability, and other metrics.

Key columns in the fact table include:

- `product_id`: Unique identifier for each shoe.
- `availability`: Quantity left in stock (not sold).
- `country`: Country where the stock is available.
- `size`: Shoe size.
- `category`: Shoe type or classification.

---

## Tools and Techniques

This project leverages:

- **Python**: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
  - Libraries used: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards to visualize inventory trends.

---

## Key Insights

Here are some findings from the analysis:

1. **Low Stock Alerts**:
   - Identified products with critical stock levels (<10 units).
   - Highlighted countries with recurring low-stock items.

2. **Country Trends**:
   - Certain regions (e.g., most shoes in UK are sold out) showed high demand for specific shoe categories.

3. **Size Analysis**:
   - Smaller sizes (e.g., Sizes 30 -36 Germany) were consistently overstocked, leading to potential inefficiencies.
   - Larger sizes (e.g., Sizes 14 -18 in the UK) faced frequent shortages in multiple regions.

## Visualizations

**Python Visualizations:**
- Heatmaps showing stock availability across sizes and countries.
- Bar plots highlighting categories with the highest and lowest stock levels.

**Power BI Dashboard:**
- Dynamic filters for country, size, and category.
- Product Stock Availability by Shoe Name and Gender: A stacked bar chart showcasing availability trends across different shoe names and gender categories.
- Product Stock Availability by Size: A clustered column chart highlighting availability across various shoe sizes.
- Product Availability Table: A detailed table displaying:
   - Availability
   - Product Name
   - Best for Wear
   - Stock Status

## Recommendations

Based on the insights:

1. **Reallocate Inventory**:
   - Shift overstocked items to regions with higher demand.
   - Address shortages by increasing production or reallocating stock.

2. **Seasonal Planning**:
   - Adjust stock levels proactively based on seasonal trends to meet demand fluctuations.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Implement a real-time inventory tracking system to avoid critical stock-outs.
